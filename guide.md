Here are the best places where you can enjoy the Greek food.

**The Yard**

<img src="media/theYard.jpg" alt="chouxs" width="500"/>

Even though this place beauty is hidden in its simplicity and secrecy, more people should know about it. The Yard ("Αυλή" in Greek) is a hidden paradise in the area of Psiri at he center of Athens. This difficult to find place is a traditional Greek restaurant that is bound to remind you of the 60s.

**Fairytale**

<img src="media/fairytale.jpg" alt="chouxs" width="500"/>

If you love fairytales and sweets, then you must visit this "sweet" magical place in Nea Filadelfeia. Fairytale is the ideal place where sweets and tales are mixed in a unique way. Its owners love the heroes of Disney and they have visited all of Disneys parks. Drawing their inspiration from their visits Fairytale was created, but its not only looks. The sweets served are a work of are both in appearance and taste, just be careful since you wont be the first to eat too much

**Brooklyn the taste factory**

<img src="media/brooklynTheTasteFactory.jpg" alt="drawing" width="500"/>

Even though most restaurants in Athens are located in or near the center, this particular one is not. Brooklyn the taste factory is an American-like burger house with a wide variety of burgers and similar choices. Since its in Greece though, be careful because the portioning is really generous. The stuff is really polite and the restaurants environment fits the needs of the modern college student and its also family friendly. If you actually decide to visit, keep in mind that you might wait a bit for the order to arrive since most things are made in the spot.

**LIVADIA**

<img src="media/leivadeia.jpg" alt="drawing" width="500"/>

You are hungry. You are near Omonoia and in 30 minutes you have a presentation with your team at AUEB. You need a classic OG souvlaki-kalamaki, and suddenly... BOOM. "Livadia" or "ΣΟΥΒΛΑΚΙ Η ΛΕΙΒΑΔΕΙΑ" is right next to you. Just the Holy lemon, bread/pita, fried potatoes and  kalamaki-Pork. Functioning since 1965, serves traditional tastes made with joy and meraki. The ingredients are handmade with no extra flavors & add-ons. Just the clean tasteful meat. Of course you can order a cold drink if you are thirsty or a colorful salad to accompany your appetite.

**The Doctors Wheelchair**

<img src="media/theDoctorsWheelchair.jpg" alt="drawing" width="500"/>

Even though it doesn't offer Greek recipes, "The Doctors Wheelchair"(or in Greek "Το Καροτσάκι του Γιατρού") is one of the best Greek fast food restaurants you can find in the city center. Located in the area of Psiri, this little unique restaurant offers all the delicacies a normal fast food restaurant would offer but with the generous portioning of the Greeks. If you decide to visit, I suggest trying the "Loua Loua" sandwich. This magnificent gastronomical creation will probably keep you satisfied for the rest of the day, that is if you manage to eat it whole.

*Address:*[Μιαούλη 5, Αθήνα](https://www.google.gr/maps/place/Miaouli+5,+Athina+105+54/@37.97708,23.7233708,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x14a1bd23053dac0b:0xb0155bec7836bf32!8m2!3d37.97708!4d23.7255595)|

**TELI'S CHOPS**

<img src="media/tbtt.jpg" alt="drawing" width="500"/>

"TELI'S CHOPS", or in Greek, "ΤΑ ΜΠΡΙΖΟΛΑΚΙΑ ΤΟΥ ΤΕΛΗ", is a very good hidden tavern, with only one main dish. Chops. You get in, and they just ask you how many portions to bring on table. They also serve a legendary dish as an appetizer with tomato, peppers (spicy and not) & feta cheese, all grilled, just for free. Of course fried potatoes are served with the chops. Telis's tavern started its functioning since 1977 and is still the best of its kind. A portion costs almost 10 euros but it's totally worth its money (you satiate for good). But be careful not to be confused with the real tavern, because some unfair competitors have opened a chop-shop right next to the original, with the name "Telis"! The real one is the one on your right, as you see both taverns. Anyway, words are not enough to describe the taste. We suggest you going at least one time, and you won't lose. And just a tip of advice. If you go, when the order comes in table, do not post a picture of it on any social media or something like that. You will ruin it's magicness.

Loukoumades are little bite-sized fluffy sweet honey balls which are deep fried to golden and crispy perfection. They are served soaked in hot honey syrup or perhaps with cinnamon and garnished with chopped walnuts or you can have it with your favourite garnish. LukuΜΑΔΕΣ is a must place to visit so you can try our most traditional pastry!

**Nancy's Sweet Home**

<img src="media/nancy.jpg" alt="drawing" width="500"/>

If you are a fan of sweets, that's the place for you! So many different options, but all so delicious! Being such a huge fan of chocolate, I strongly recommend it, but even if you are not so into chocolate you can find all kinds of sweets there! Juicy chocolate pies, hellish strawberry pies, southern kazan dip and many more are waiting for you. The most relaxing and sweet Candy Store in Athens is located at Psyri, really close to the Monastiraki Square.

**Mparmpeekiou**

<img src="media/mparmpeekiou.jpg" alt="drawing" width="500"/>

For meat lovers, Mparmpeekiou is heaven on earth. It started as a traditional-original stake house and later became an awarded burger house known for its huge portions, the wide variety of burgers and amazing flavors. Mparmpeekiou is located at Piraeus, Nea Smyrni and Chalandri. Don't forget to try out the most popular burger in the menu called *the brave one*, however you might win a special prize if you manage to eat the burger called *grandpa of the brave* which is equal to eating 8 entire burgers.

**Falafellas**

<img src="media/falafel.jpg" alt="drawing" width="500"/>

If you are in the mood for a good falafel, look no more! "Falafellas" is a small shop right in the heart of Athens(on the central street called "Aiolou").No matter the time you decide to visit, you will probably have to wait for a while, since there are always people waiting in line to have a taste of the delicious falafel. Don't worry though, the line moves on quickly and it is totally worth the wait. You can order the classic falafel, as much spicy as you want it, or you can go for the meatball one. Both of them are amazing!

**Vlachika**

<img src="media/Vlachika.jpg" alt="drawing" width="500"/>

If you are a meat lover, then Vlachika is the perfect place to taste quality and delicious greek bbq. There they offer a large variety of meat based dishes, so you can choose and eat any delicacies such us beef grilled steak, grilled lamb chops, pork on a spit (in Greek γουρνοπούλα) and many other grilled dishes. In Vlachica you can also taste traditional Greek dishes such as Mousakas, Pastitsio, Gemista etc. One the best dishes that you can taste in Vlachika is the lamb on a spit and Kokoretsi. Lamb on a spit and Kokoretsi are the most traditional, popular and delicious meals in Greece, so I strongly recommend them! Vlachika are located at the southern suburbs of Athens on a region called Vari.

**Kostas Souvlaki Shop**

<img src= "media/kwstas.jpg" alt= "drawing" width="500"/>

It may be hidden in a small passage of Mitropoleos street which does not grab your attention at first sight, but judging from the large queue of people waiting outside for a souvlaki you can understand that something unique is located there. There is the small shop of Kostas, whose traditional souvlaki is worshipped not only by Athenians but also from a lot of tourists, since its fame has reached a lot of tourist guides about Athens.

**Cookoomela**

<img src="media/Cookoomela.jpg" alt="Cookoomela" width="500"/>

Cookoomela is the perfect place to eat a vegan souvlaki in Athens. Cookoomela's menu remains small and at the same time complete. Five wrapped skewers, potatoes and a salad. Skewers' main ingredients are mushrooms or lentil meatballs, which are enriched with a variety of healthy, fresh and handmade ingredients such as authentic Sicilian recipe tomato sauce, avocado, vegan mayo, mustard, organic vegan yogurt sauce, vegan cheese, salad and bbq sauce.

**Hoocut**

<img src="media/hoocut.jpg" alt="drawing" width="500"/>

"Seeking a true dining experience will bring you to Hoocut. Here we make the real souvlaki right from the start, wanting to offer you a product with top quality raw materials, simple techniques and culinary thinking."

Someone would probably think that you can't fit another souvlaki in the center of Athens but I'm sure you will understand the reason this restaurant made the list the moment you take the first bite! Great quality ingredients and different choices in the meat like beef or lamb will surely introduce you to a souvlaki flavour you never knew before. Hoocut is placed at Platia Agias Eirinis 9 in Athens (near Monastiraki square).

**Karaflas Original**

<img src="media/karaflas.jpg" alt="drawing" width="500"/>

You don't want to miss out the best creperie in town! Karaflas Original is placed in Zografou and you can get there by bus. I strongly suggest you go there and totally recommend you take a sweet crepe. My favourite with chocolate and biscuit but you can have everything you want even if its not a sweet crepe. The place offers you a lot of ingredients you can choose from, so feel free to get there and choose after you have seen all possible choices. The best part about this place and the one thing that makes it so unique is that whatever you choose to have, the ingredients will not only be inside the crepe but also above it. So make sure when you get there that you are starving in order to eat the whole thing. If you are not ,  you can share it with someone else and still be too much for both of you.

**Bouzoukia**

<img src="media/bouzoukia.jpg" alt="drawing" width="500"/>

There are two types of bouzoukia, or pistes, which literally means ‘stages’. First there are the big ones. Think of them as a cross between an indoor concert and a club. You’ll find these venues around Iera Odos in the Gazi neighbourhood and Syngrou Avenue during the winter, and on Posidonos Avenue, which runs along the city’s southern coastline, in the summer. This is where you get to see the biggest stars of the Greek popular music scene: Sakis Rouvas, Anna Vissi, Antonis Remos, Despina Vandi, Giorgos Mazonakis, Paola, and so on.

Then there are the smaller, borderline cult stages, that we call skyladika, which literally means “where the dogs hang out.” There’s an interesting backstory here. Think of these as the B-list versions of the glamourous bouzoukia, where the singers, musicians and booze are second-class, where the flowers could have been stolen from a nearby cemetery, and where many of the customers are dodgy characters of the night.

**Monastiraki**

Stroll around the picturesque Monastiraki and Plaka neighbourhoods
Feel the atmosphere of "old Athens" and get the touch of history on the pedestrian streets.
It’s hard to imagine how many different experiences can fit in two neighbourhoods of a city centre! Archaeological sites, little arrays, old beautiful houses, antique shops and pittoresque cafes live together in the neighbourhoods of old Athens.
Plaka is full of people, colours and music! With the “tavernas” (typical Greek restaurants), the little shops, the cozy cafés, you will feel like playing in a movie of the ’60s. Don't miss out!

**Kifissia**

<img src="media/kifissia.jpg" alt="drawing" width="500"/>

Just 14km from downtown Athens – or a short, 35-minute ride from Monastiraki on the electric railway (HSAP), Kifissia is a great choice for an action-packed day. Enjoy glamorous shopping, admire wonderful art, dine at a restaurant and study a fascinating mix of centuries-old mansions. Here you can relish cool air, abundant greenery and a sense of nonchalant affluence that is light years away from the sometimes overwhelming chaos of the city center. While Kifissia’s boutiques may be the exclusive domain of the elite, there is an abundance of things to discover and explore beyond shopping.

**Koukaki**

<img src="media/koukaki.jpg" alt="drawing" width="500"/>

This residential neighborhood, located at the foot of the Acropolis and the Filopappou Hill, is a combination of authenticity, convenience and entertainment. One of Koukaki’s highlights is the blend of architectural styles it contains. With its mismatch of neoclassical houses, low-rise buildings dating from the 1930s and post-1970s apartment blocks, Koukaki includes small shops, traditional restaurants, art galleries, museums and colorful bars and cafes. After a leisurely stroll around the streets, you can be sure to always find a café with a couple of tables and chairs set up outside where we suspect your coffee break will quickly turn into an impromptu lunch. Whether you are on your own or with friends, looking to celebrate a special occasion or simply want to hang, Koukaki has it all.

**Thisseio**

<img src="media/thisseio.jpg" alt="drawing" width="500"/>

Picture-perfect Thisseio is an ideal district for relaxing strolls and evening walks with views over century-old monuments. In addition to Filopappou Hill, the pedestrian street of Dyonisus Areopagitou and the lines of street vendors selling crafts and jewelry are just some of the highlights. Green, quiet and charming, Thisseio has also its fair share of cafés, bars and restaurants, where during the warm days, you can find a quiet corner on a terrace to enjoy a great book or an intense conversation with your friends. And just when you thought you knew everything about Thisseio, it surprises you with its small collection of museums, such as the Herakleidon Museum of Visual Arts, housed in a neoclassical mansion, or the "Stoa of Attalos Museum", located in the Ancient Agora.

**Filopappou Hill**

<img src="media/filopappou.jpg" alt="drawing" width="500"/>

Filopappou hill, also called the Hill of the Muses, is the perfect spot for a stroll especially at sunset! The hill offers a breathtaking view to the Saronic Gulf and of course and a really advantaging point to take a photo of the Acropolis. Of course there is a lot of history hidden in this hill. The monument of Filopappos, which identifies the hill, was built between AD 114 and 116 in honour of Julius Antiochus Filopappos, a prominent Roman consul and administrator.

**The Acropolis Museum**

<img src="media/acropolisMuseum.jpg" alt="drawing" width="500"/>

The Acropolis Museum is consistently rated as one of the best museums in the world. Devoted to the Parthenon and its surrounding temples, it is cleverly perched above Athens like a luminous box. The large glass panes beautifully draw in the ancient and modern parts of the city, making it a truly evocative experience. Designed by New York’s, Bernard Tschumi, with local Greek architect Michael Photiadis, it is the perfect sanctuary for the ancient artefacts that were found in and around the Acropolis and successfully deconstructs how the Parthenon sculptures once looked to the citizens of ancient Athens.

**National Archaeological Museum**

<img src="media/nationalMuseum.jpg" alt="drawing" width="500"/>

The National Archaeological Museum of Athens, built between 1866 and 1889, was initially named the Central Museum. It was first established to display the numerous findings dating from the beginning of Prehistory to Late Antiquity excavated in Athens and its surroundings. In later years, it housed objects from all over the country. During World War II, the imposing neoclassical building was closed, and its pieces were placed in wooden boxes and buried to avoid the German troops from looting them. Once the war was over, the museum was reopened in 1945.

The collection is displayed along the museum’s two floors and is divided into various exhibitions, including the Prehistory Collection, the Sculpture Collection, the Vase and Minor Objects Collection and the Metallurgy Collection. It also houses a varied art collection from Ancient Egypt.

## <a name="monuments"></a>Monuments

Athens is famous for its history and its numerous monuments and museums, you don't want to miss that part.

**Acropolis**

>The most famous historical monument in Greece

<img src="media/acropolis.jpg" alt="drawing" width="500"/>

The Acropolis of Athens is the most famous historical monument in Greece. It was constructed in the mid 5th century BC, also known as the Golden Century of Athens. Although the most famous building on the Acropolis is the Parthenon, there are many other buildings, like the Propylaea, the Erechtheion and the Temple of Athena Nike. The Acropolis was entirely made of the finest Pentelic marble and by the best craftsmen of the era. Along the centuries that followed, it was largely destroyed by wars. The greatest destructions were in 1687 by a Venetian gun, and in 1816 when Lord Elgin removed many parts of the Parthenon frieze.

**Parthenon**

<img src="media/parthenon.jpg" alt="drawing" width="500"/>

This magnificent temple on the Acropolis of Athens was built between 447 and 432 BCE in the Age of Pericles, and was dedicated to goddess Athena, the city's patron. It was designed by architects Iktinos and Kallikrates, while the sculptor Pheidias supervised the entire building process and conceived the temple's sculptural decoration and [chryselephantine statue of Athena](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athena_Parthenos). The temple is considered to be the epitome of Classical Greece.

**Erechtheion**

<img src="media/erechtheion.jpg" alt="drawing" width="500"/>

The Erechtheion is an ancient Greek temple located on the north side of the Acropolis. The temple was erected in 421-406 BC and was dedicated to both Athena and Poseidon. In particular, the eastern part of the building was dedicated to Athena Polias, while the western part served the cult of Poseidon-Erechtheus and held the altars of Hephaestus and Voutos, brother of Erechtheus.

On the north side of the temple, there is the famous "Porch of the Maidens", with six sculpted female figures (Caryatids) serving as supporting columns. Five of them are in the Acropolis Museum and the last one in the British Museum; those on the building are casts.

**Temple of Poseidon**

<img src="media/templeofposeidon.jpg" alt="drawing" width="500"/>

One of the most stunning views all over Greece as well as a monument difficult to forget. Located at the southernmost tip of Attica the Temple of Poseidon is build to impress and educate us about history. Stories around this temple involve King Menelaus who stopped there on his way back from Troy and King Aegeus who had the unfortunate fate of drowning on that spot, thus giving his name to the Aegean Sea.

Organizing a trip to the Temple of Poseidon is worth your time but making the most of your trip is also important by swimming on the beach, underneath the monument, getting an astonishing experience of clear blue waters.

**Panathenaic Stadium**

<img src="media/panathenaic-stadium.jpg" alt="drawing" width="500"/>

The Panathenaic Stadium, or Kallimarmaro is another famous attraction in Athens. It’s located in front of Zappeion Park’s Southern entrance. It was built around 330 BC and it was where ancient Athens’ Panathenaic Games were celebrated. After being left abandoned for centuries, it was refurbished in late 19th century using Penteli marble, the same as the one used on the Acropolis. The name Kallimarmaro literally translates to “beautiful marble”, which is aptly named as it is famous for being the world’s only stadium made entirely out of marble. Its rich history is directly connected to the Modern Olympic Games as from their revival in 1896 until the Athens Olympic Games in 2004. It is also the place from where the Olympic flame sets up its journey to the cities of the Olympic Games, both Winter, Summer and Youth. From its highest tiers you can see the Acropolis and the National Garden.

## <a name="fun"></a>Fun and Games

While you are in Athens you can have fun and enjoy your time there, doing a lot of different things.

**Great Escape Rooms**

<img src="media/greatescape.jpg" alt="drawing" width="500"/>

If you don't know already what escape rooms are about, I can personally guarantee you that you are going to have a lot of fun while you are "locked" inside a theme room(approximately 1 to 2 hours). Great Escape Rooms is the biggest real life escape room game in Athens. The whole idea behind these rooms is that teams consisting of 2-8 people focus on completing a certain task within the given timeframe by overcoming obstacles and solving puzzles. In some challenges there is an actor or many actors inside this room with you, helping you out or the exact opposite. Of course, some of these challenges are scaring, but if you are too afraid to get locked inside a "haunted" room, don't worry there are also rooms that are not scaring at all. These rooms will expand your imagination and exercise your perceptual skills as well. Thus, you will not activate only your mind but all of your 5 senses. In extreme cases, you may need to be athletic in order to enter a certain type of room. Great Escape Rooms are located in Psirri, really close to the Monastiraki square, so it is very easily accessible through by the metro or by train.

**The VR Project**

<img src="media/vr.jpg" alt="drawing" width="500"/>

Virtual Reality is a simulated experience that can be similar to the real world. It can be applied for entertaining or educational purposes. While you are on a trip you want to have fun so let's focus on the entertainment part. The VR Project is the first virtual reality center in Greece. It is placed in the city center, and specifically at Monastiraki. The VR Project is available with individual or multiplayer adventures. The suggested duration for this experience is 1 to 2 hours and we guarantee you that this is the best place to get a first try or re-discover the potential of this new technology. You can choose from different categories what you want to do, for example you can visit a place really far from here if you are a fan of travelling. From a personal experience, if you are fan of video games that is the best place for you. You will discover a whole different perspective of your favourite video games. My suggestion for you is to pick a scary video game: your heartbeat is going to raise, your palms are going to get sweaty and get frightened by the plot of the video game that you have chosen, since the experience is too real and you will think that you are a part of this video game. But even if you don't want that, whatever video game you choose it is a experience worth living!

**Cine Paris**

<img src="media/cineparis.jpg" alt="drawing" width="500"/>

What a better way to enjoy your evening than watching a movie in a rooftop garden Cinema. If you are visiting Athens from May to October then I highly recommend you go there. It is a beautiful place in Plaka, where you can watch a movie under the stars, with the Acropolis lit on your left. Plaka is a beautiful and very interesting area in Athens and you can get there using the train station that it is located in the heart of Plaka. You can choose to watch the movie either tables in the stalls, or small private balconies. There are a lot of different kinds of movies playing and they change every now and then, so choose your favourite one and come watch it. Most of the movies are in English with Greek subtitles, so you don't have a problem keeping up with the movie and its plot. If you are a fan of movies and cinemas don't miss this place, it is totally worth it! And don't forget, there is a snack bar waiting for you to get your drinks and snacks.

You are downtown in Athens and you want to have fun with your friends or family; I have the best place for you! Playhouse is really close to the Monastiraki train and metro station(4 minutes on foot), so it should be really easy for you to access the place. Polite and friendly people are ready to welcome you to the store and make sure you have a great time there. You can play a whole lot of different kind of games, from speed and puzzle to strategy and memory. It is a big place so whatever category you choose from there are a lot of games for you. If you don't know how a game works don't panic there are people there for you to explain all the rules of the game simply and quickly. While you are there don't forget that you can enjoy your drink or food, which is really good. MY personal favourite waffle with chocolate and biscuit, but there are not only sweets there. So if you don't want something sweet I would suggest that you get a club sandwich.
