- Contribute generously and in several categories.
- Add interesting things __use references if you reuse others' material__
- Introduce new categories, organize things
- Feel free to add images/videos

**Deadline – 12:00 PM, March 11, 2020**

## Tips
- Include links where necessary (i.e., locations, bars, etc.)
- You can include pictures, but don't forget to commit and push them. Pictures should be placed in the ```media/``` directory. Create the directory if does not exist. 
- Rearrange text if you think that it should be organized different - refactorings are always welcome!
- Use references for pictures and videos - You cannot reuse web content without citing the original source

## Grading system
- Number of contributions - the more the better
- Completeness of each contribution. (one sentence contributions are 'bad' contributions)
- Breaking things have a penalty... 
- Fixing others' breaks have a bonus!
- Quality of commit messages - descriptive (of the change) and concise. Default commit messages are not welcome... 
- Missing references in reused material is not welcome. 
- Content should be in proper Markdown format. Check the [Mardkown cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).
